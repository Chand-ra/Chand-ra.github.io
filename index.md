Hey there! I am Chandra, an undergraduate Mathematics student at SVNIT, Surat, India with a passion for everything tech! I love geeking out about new technologies and discovering the ingenuity of old ones. The easiest way to reach me would be through an e-mail but I wouldn't mind a DM in any of my social handles either.
