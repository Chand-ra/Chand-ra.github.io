This week marks week 11 of GSoC's official Coding Period. Similar to the previous few, the majority of my time this week was devoted to writing code for the reftable tests in the unit testing framework.
## Goals accomplished
- **Work on feedback from the mailing list**: I sent the patch series for stack and readwrite test migration to the mailing list and received feedback on them. The patch series for stack had to be put on hold because that test file is currently undergoing some other development on the mailing list. As for readwrite test, I sent the patch series to the mailing list a couple of times and received feedback on them, I will rework the commits and roll the updated version in the next week. Hopefully it's in a good enough position to be merged to upstream by now.

## Next week's goals
I have finished the work for eight tests (readwrite, stack, merged, tree, pq, record, block and basics) until now, but only five (tree, basics, merged, pq and record) have been merged with upstream. Hence, similar to the last week, my primary goal for the next week is to get more tests reviewed and merged with upstream. Other than that, I will try to find and work on some other tasks related to the reftable sub-project.

## Challenges
Like last week, this one was more or less a smooth sailing as well and I faced little to no issues, thanks to the experience I accumulated from the work I performed in the last few weeks.

_Till next time,_

_Chandra_.
