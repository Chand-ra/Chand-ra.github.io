This week marks week 6 of GSoC's official Coding Period, which means half of the program is over by now. Similar to the previous few, the majority of my time this week was devoted to writing code for the reftable tests in the unit testing framework.

## Goals accomplished
- **Work on porting readwrite test to the unit testing framework**: Most of the work for this test was completed last week, but there were still a few finishing touches that I wished to add. These are still in-progress and should not take too long to complete.
- **Finish porting merged test to the unit testing framework**: I finished a large part of my planned work for these tests last week, and the work was completely finished by this week. I sent the resulting patch for this test to the mailing list and recieved feedback on it as well.
- **Work on porting stack test to the unit testing framework**: I started working on this test simultaneously alongside merged test last week and made some good progress. There is still some work left to be done which I couldn't get to this week, so I will try to finish this up by the next week.
- **Work on feedback from the mailing list**: I sent the patch series for merged test migration to the mailing list this week and received feedback on it. I have addressed almost all the feedback received, and plan to send the patch series back to the mailing list next week.
- What I did up until last week.

## Next week's goals
I have finished the work for six tests (merged, tree, pq, record, block and basics) until now, but only two (basics and record) has been merged with upstream. Hence, similar to last week, one of my goals for the next week is to get more tests merged with upstream. Other than that, I will try to finish the work on the remaining tests.

## Challenges
Like last week, this one was more or less a smooth sailing as well. I did face some roadblocks but was able to get over them due to the experience I accumulated from the work I performed in the last few weeks. Hopefully I can continue to do the same in the future.

_Till next time,_

_Chandra_.
