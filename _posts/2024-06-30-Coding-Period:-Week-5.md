This week marks week 5 of GSoC's official Coding Period. Similar to the previous few, the majority of my time this week was devoted to writing code for the reftable tests in the unit testing framework.

## Goals accomplished
- **Work on porting readwrite test to the unit testing framework**: Most of the work for this test was completed last week, but there were still a few finishing touches that I wished to add. These are still in-progress and should be completed by the next week.
- **Work on porting merged test to the unit testing framework**: I decided to work on merged test next. I was able to finish a large part of my planned work for these tests in this week, and the work should be finished by the next week.
- **Work on porting stack test to the unit testing framework**: I started working on this test simultaneously alongside merged test and have made some good progress. I'll try to finish this test by the next week, but that depends on the progress made with the other tests (readwrite and merged) so I'm not very sure if I'll be able to.
- **Work on feedback from the mailing list**: I sent the patch series for record test migration to the mailing list this week and received feedback on them. I addressed almost all the feedback received, and sent the patch series patches back to the mailing list.

## Next week's goals
I have finished the work for five tests (tree, pq, record, block and basics) until now, but only one (basics) has been merged with upstream. Hence, similar to last week, one of my goals for the next week is to get more tests merged with upstream. Other than that, I will try to finish the work on the remaining tests.

## Challenges
Like last week, this one was more or less a smooth sailing as well. I did face some roadblocks but was able to get over them due to the experience I accumulated from the work I performed in the last few weeks. Hopefully I can continue to do the same in the future.

_Till next time,_

_Chandra_.
