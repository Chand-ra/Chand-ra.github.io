This week marks week 8 of GSoC's official Coding Period. Similar to the previous few, the majority of my time this week was devoted to writing code for the reftable tests in the unit testing framework.

## Goals accomplished
- **Work on porting readwrite test to the unit testing framework**: Most of the work for this test was completed last week, but there were still a few finishing touches that I wished to add. These are still in-progress and should not take too long to complete.
- **Work on feedback from the mailing list**: I sent the patch series for tree test migration to the mailing list this week and received feedback on it. I addressed almost all the feedback received, and will send the patch series back to the mailing list next week. Hopefully it's in a good enough position to be merged to upstream by now.

## Next week's goals
I have finished the work for seven tests (stack, merged, tree, pq, record, block and basics) until now, but only three (basics, merged and record) have been merged with upstream. Hence, similar to last week, one of my goals for the next week is to get more tests merged with upstream. Other than that, I will try to finish the work on the only remaining test, readwrite.

## Challenges
Like last week, this one was more or less a smooth sailing as well. I did face some miniscule issues here and there but was able to easily get past them due to the experience I accumulated from the work I performed in the last few weeks.

_Till next time,_

_Chandra_.
