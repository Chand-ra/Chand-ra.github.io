## SoB: Week 1

## Overview
The official Summer of Bitcoin (SoB) internship began on May 15, 2025; however, due to academic obligations and personal matters, I didn’t start the project until Sunday, May 18, 2025. Nonetheless, I’ve made solid progress over the past week. During my weekly meetings with my mentor, Matt Morehourse, we agreed on a basic work plan for the project. I didn't have to face a lot of the initial hurdles that come when starting work on a new project—thanks to the work I put in pre-SoB—and started working right away on improving the tests. The enhancements I added to the fuzz tests may have uncovered some bugs, although this isn’t yet certain.

## Goals accomplished
- **Added improvements to fuzz-addr**: Before this improment, `fuzz-addr` only tested encoding via `encode_scriptpubkey_to_addr()`, without checking decoding. I added a round‑trip assertion: if encoding produces an address, decode it back with `decode_scriptpubkey_from_addr()` and confirm the result matches the original scriptpubkey. Full details of the change can be seen at [PR #8297](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8297).

- **Add a test for amount-{sat, msat} arithmetic**: While reviewing the `fuzz-amount` test, I noticed that many procedures in the target file, `common/amount.{c,h}`, were untested. I decided to write a test for the arithmetic operations, since they may receive input from untrusted sources.

  The test revealed two potential bugs: one in `amount_(sat, msat)_scale()`, where negative `scale` values aren’t handled properly, and another in `amount_msat_sub_fee()`, where certain parameter values can trigger assertion failures within the function. I’ve already submitted [PR #8306](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8306) to fix the first issue; as for the second, I need to investigate further before confirming it as a bug. Details of this change can be seen at [PR #8298](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8298).

- **Added improvements to fuzz-bigsize**: Added a couple of small improvements to the `fuzz-bigsize` test. The resulting PR can be accessed at [PR #8301](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8301).

- **Added improvements to fuzz-bech32**: The existing test for `fuzz-bech32` only tests 5-to-8 bit conversion. I added a roundtrip check for 8-to-5 bit conversion as well to test the conversion procedure more thoroughly. I plan on pushing this change in the near future.

- **Added a test for error/warn message handler**: My current strategy for adding new tests to the suite is to go through the [BOLT specifications](https://github.com/lightning/bolts) and fuzz the message handler for each type of message. As such, I decided to start with [BOLT #1](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/01-messaging.md) and discovered that `handle_peer_error_or_warning()` in `common/read_peer_message.{c, h}` is responsible for parsing any incoming `error` or `warning` messages, and hence added a test for it resulting in [PR #8304](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8304).

  The test is WIP for now because the target crashes when run, potentially due to a bug in the message handler. I did some investigation around the breakage and concluded that there's a good chance this isn't a false positive, so I informed Matt and he told me he'd look into it later.

- **Reviewed other tests**: Besides the ones above, I took a look at the following tests but couldn't think of any ways to improve them so they're off the checklist for now: `fuzz-bolt12-bech32-decode`, `fuzz-bolt12-invoice-decode`, `fuzz-bolt12-invrequest-decode`, and `fuzz-bolt12-offer-decode`.

- **Added a test for BOLT #12 check_signature()**:  `common/bolt12.c::check_signature()` verifies incoming peer signatures according to the [BOLT #12 specification](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/12-offer-encoding.md). While reviewing the `fuzz-bolt12-*` tests, I noticed that `common/bolt12.c::check_signature()` was untested by the current suite. Hence, I added a new fuzz test to ensure `check_signature()` correctly validates signatures received over the wire. I plan on pushing this test to upstream soon.

- **Polished previous patches**: I received feedback on my previous work—like the [differential test for HMAC-SHA256](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8185) that I developed before SoB, as well as some of the changes noted above—and spent time addressing them to secure an ACK for each update.

## Next week's goals
I plan on using the same strategy for the next week that I used this week, which is to divide my time into incrementally reviewing the existing tests and working towards writing a new one. With this being said, here are some of my immediate goals for the next week:

- **Investigate the potential bug in `amount_msat_sub_fee()`**: After discussing this with Matt, we recognize that when one of CLN’s assertions fails, it typically indicates a bug—potentially severe if an attacker can provoke it. I will investigate whether an attacker can trigger this assertion failure. If so, it represents a DoS vulnerability that must be promptly reported to the CLN team. I attempted to simulate such an attack by adding a test late last week, but it proved inconclusive. I will continue from where I left off and aim to identify a substantive issue.

- **Investigate the potential bug in `handle_peer_error_or_warning()`**: This “dereferencing NULL pointer” bug was detected by UBSAN. I’ve performed an initial investigation, but I have additional ideas that I believe will yield stronger conclusions. I plan to explore these over the next week.

- **Review `fuzz-bip32` and `fuzz-bolt11`**: I believe I’ve already reviewed these two tests, but I don’t have a commit or note to confirm it. I’ll revisit them to identify any possibilities for improvement. Going forward, I’ll note down each test I review—especially since I’ve been working through them out of order.

- **Review other tests**: I plan to review at least five new tests next week. This will help me stay aligned with the schedule I outlined in my proposal.

- **Finish tests for BOLT #1 message handlers**: I plan to complete the BOLT #1 message handlers by midweek. I’ve already identified where most of them live, so this shouldn't be too difficult.

- **Start working on BOLT #2 message handlers**: Given the timeline, I’ll begin work on the BOLT #2 messages next week. With twelve BOLT specifications in total, aiming to complete one spec per week is the reasonable goal.

## Challenges
I encountered several challenges this week but made steady progress. Fixing the `fuzz-amount-arith` test proved difficult—while they still fail, I’m hopeful this reflects a genuine bug in CLN rather than my implementation. I also ran into linker errors, but after some digging I discovered `tools/update-mocks.sh`, which generates mocks for missing functions. Since it only covered unit tests, I updated the `Makefile` to include fuzz targets as well, alleviating many of my linker concerns.

Identifying the BOLT message handlers was tricky because of similar names across functions and files, but I think I have the hang of it now. Aside from these bigger hurdles, I encountered a few minor issues—but nothing I couldn’t resolve with assistance from Matt or AI tools. My prior work—including pre-SoB contributions and other open-source experience—proved invaluable for overcoming these day-to-day problems.

***
Matt is on vacation, so our next meeting is scheduled for next Monday. In the meantime, I hope to achieve solid results from my bug investigations and to review and add a substantial number of tests without compromising quality. If I stick to my plan, this should be entirely feasible.

_Till next time,_

_Chandra_.
