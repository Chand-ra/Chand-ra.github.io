## SoB: Week 8

## Overview
Most of my time this week was spent optimizing the `open_channel` fuzzer and following up on received feedback. In addition, I also explored a few new fuzz target ideas.

## Goals accomplished
- **Reworked the `tlv_invoice_request` target**: I received feedback on the `tlv_invoice_request` wire fuzzer that I pushed earlier this week, and it turned out that the functions I was trying to fuzz are already tested at a higher level by the existing `fuzz-bolt12-invrequest-decode` test. Instead of discarding the new target and the work I had put into it, I decided to rework it as an improvement to the existing test. The rework is now complete, and the resulting PR is [#8485](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8404).

- **Reworked the `tlv_offer` target**: I’d already created a fuzz test for `tlv_offer`, but I later realized that its marshalling and unmarshalling functions are already covered by the existing `fuzz-bolt12-offer` test. Following the same approach as with the `tlv_invoice_request` fuzzer, I reworked my new test into an enhancement for that existing target. The work is now complete, and I’ll push the improvements upstream shortly.

- **Reworked the `parse_onion_message` target**: One of my main goals for the week was to revisit and improve the fuzz targets I had already written, focusing on increasing their code coverage to a satisfactory level. I started with the `parse_onion_message` target. Instead of fuzzing the core `parse_onion_message()` function in `common/parse_onion_message.c` directly, I restructured the target so that the fuzzer's entry point is the actual handler for onion messages from peers- `handle_onion()` in `connectd/onion_message.c`.

  Rewriting the target took about a day, but the result is a much more realistic and comprehensive test that exercises the full path down to `parse_onion_message()`. The target works well and I plan to push it upstream in the upcoming week.

- **Addressed received feedback**: I received feedback on some of the fuzz targets I had previously pushed upstream, including the one for `codex32` operations. A good portion of my time this week was spent addressing that feedback and making the necessary changes. I'll continue monitoring for any further suggestions, but for now, the updates have been implemented and I'm ready to move forward with the remaining work. 

- **Improved the `open_channel` target**: In my efforts to trigger the bug in `initial_channel_tx()`, I focused on improving the fuzz target for `fundee_channel()`, which processes incoming `open_channel` messages from peers. While I had started this work last week, it turned out to be much more involved than anticipated and extended into this week as well. I'm happy to report that the effort paid off, the improved target successfully triggers the bug in `initial_channel_tx()`.

  This likely indicates a serious DoS vulnerability, although I’ll need further confirmation to be certain. I've already notified Matt about the finding and pushed the new `open_channel` target along with the crashing input upstream in [PR #8411](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8411). The next steps now depend on his assessment.

## Next week's goals
Here are some of my immediate goals for the next week:

- **Add a target for `channeld-connectd` interface**: `peer_in()` in `channeld/channeld.c` is responsible for handling connectd messages such as `UPDATE_ADD_HTLC` and `REVOKE_AND_ACK`. Given its stateful structure, I planned to add a stateful fuzz test simulating this function in this week but couldn't find the time to do it, so I plan on tackling this in the upcoming week.

- **Revisit the finished targets**: I planned on revisiting some of my complex targets to ensure they exercise their code paths more effectively, and I've started implementing the plan with the `onion_message_parse` fuzzer, but there's still a lot of targets left, so I plan on doing the same for them in the upcoming week.

- **Possibly complete the target for `channeld-lightningd` interface**: I had already completed the initial work for this target, but after my last discussion with Matt, I realized that the `lightningd` interfaces aren't particularly valuable fuzzing targets, as they generally don't handle untrusted input directly. That said, since I’ve already invested time into developing this fuzzer, I’d still like to wrap it up quickly if I get the opportunity, rather than letting the work go to waste.

## Challenges
The open_channel target ended up taking significantly more time than I had anticipated—roughly two full days. While I’m glad I was ultimately able to achieve the depth I was aiming for with this target, this experience reinforced something I noted in last week's **Challenges** section: pushing fuzzers to reach meaningful depth tends to be a time-intensive process. With that in mind, I’ll need to be more selective moving forward and prioritize targets where I believe the investment is most likely to yield impactful results.

***
Week 8 of SoB wraps up this week, with midterm evaluation results expected at the start of the next. I'm fairly confident about passing, though of course, there’s always a bit of uncertainty until it's official.

  This week, I had to allocate some time to prepare for my upcoming semester, which meant slightly less time for SoB work during weekdays. That said, I made sure to catch up over the weekend to stay on track. Looking ahead, I expect academic responsibilities to take up more of my time, so my goal is to get as much meaningful work done as possible before the semester fully kicks in.

_Till next time,_

_Chandra_.
